      <p>
        Located on Eddy Street Commons, Step-Brothers Bar & Grill was founded in
        1984 in South Bend, Indiana, by our founding "Step-Brothers", Patrick
        Jameson and Zach Daniels. We offer a warm and cosy indoor and outdoor
        space with an atmosphere that acts as a place for friends and family, as
        well as wanderers and adventurers alike, to bond over an ice-cold pint
        and some good, hearty food.
